# AcronymSearch

## User Stroies
As an user, I’d like to :
- [x] see a text search box.
- [x] see the display of the full organisation name for that acronym if one exists.
- [x] see an appropriate message is displayed, if no such acronym exists. 
- [x] see an autocomplete is available on the search box, when I begin to type acronyms that match the letters I entered are presented in a dropdown
- [x] see a partial matching (e.g. if a user searches for “DC”, results are returned for both “DCMS” and “DCLG”)
